      Sellsword Arts is many things, but at its most basic it is a celebration
      of swordsmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether that be fencing, choreography, history, or pop culture, we are all
      about the blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are dedicated to creating videos that help educate people about how
      swords work while making you laugh.
