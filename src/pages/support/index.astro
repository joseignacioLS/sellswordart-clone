        We love making videos that people can enjoy for free, but sometimes the
        YouTube algorithm doesn't quite make ends meet.

        Supporting the channel on Patreon is a HUGE help! It's a consistent
        amount of money that we can count on each month, which is incredibly
        helpful!
